> **Note:** This repository only contains the core code of the Wolff framework. If you want to build a new Wolff project, visit the main [Wolff repository](https://github.com/usbac/wolff).

Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework with useful functions and utilities like a route, template, extensions and language system.

It is intended for those who want to build light websites without having to do everything from scratch or using too large/complicated frameworks.

Wolff is small, fast, scalable and easy. The perfect solution for building small and medium-sized web applications.


## Features

* **Fast**: Due to its small size and simplicity, you don’t have to worry about loading times or resource usage.

* **Simple**: It’s not only small, but simple as well; with a clean documentation and easy way to use.

* **Extensible**: Take advantage of the custom extensions and templates you can make in Wolff to expand your page.

* **Clean**: The routes system allows you to have clean and friendly URLs, and the template system makes the php code cleaner while separating the logic from the view.

* **Dynamic**: You can work however you want without strictly following the Wolff design or patterns like the MVC.
