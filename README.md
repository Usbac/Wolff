Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework.

It is intended for those who want to build lightweight websites without starting from scratch or dealing with large frameworks.

Wolff is small, fast, scalable and easy. The perfect solution for building small and medium-sized web applications.


> **Note:** The core code of the framework is available at [Wolff-framework](https://github.com/usbac/wolff-framework).


## Features

* **Clean**: The routes system allows you to have clean and friendly URLs, and the template system makes the php code cleaner while separating the logic from the view.

* **Dynamic**: You can work however you want without strictly following the Wolff design or patterns like the MVC.

* **Extensible**: Take advantage of the custom middlewares, functions and templates you can make in Wolff to expand your page.

* **Fast**: Due to its small size and simplicity, you don’t have to worry about loading times or resource usage.

* **Simple**: It’s not only small, but simple as well; with a clean documentation and an easy way to use.
