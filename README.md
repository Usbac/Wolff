Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework with useful functions and utilities like a route, template, extensions and language system.

It is intended for those who want to build light websites without having to do everything from scratch or using too large/complicated frameworks.

Wolff is small, fast, scalable and easy. The perfect solution for building small and medium-sized web applications.


> **Note:** The core code of the framework is available at [Wolff-framework](https://github.com/usbac/wolff-framework).

## Features

* **Fast**: Due to its small size and simplicity, you don’t have to worry about loading times or resource usage.

* **Simple**: It’s not only small, but simple as well; with a clean documentation and easy way to use.

* **Extensible**: Take advantage of the custom extensions and templates you can make in Wolff to expand your page.

* **Clean**: The routes system allows you to have clean and friendly URLs, and the template system makes the php code cleaner while separating the logic from the view.

* **Dynamic**: You can work however you want without strictly following the Wolff design or patterns like the MVC.

## Utilities

* **Route**: A route system that allows you to have clean URLs, make redirections and block certain pages recursively.

* **Database**: Wolff has a Database abstraction layer which simplifies the process of running queries and includes some useful functions.

* **Template**: With the optional template system you can write cleaner code in your views and avoid things like the php tags.

* **Cache**: An optional cache system which can increase the overall loading speed of your pages.

* **Uploader**: Simplify and optimize the process of uploading files with the uploader system of Wolff.

* **Session**: Have cleaner code using the session class instead of managing the php session variables directly.

* **Extension**: An useful and descriptive extension system which gives you more control over your site.

* **Language**: For managing multiple languages easily and quickly.

And more...
