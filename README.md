Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework, intended for those who want to build web applications without starting from scratch or dealing with complexity. 

Wolff is the perfect solution for building small and medium-sized web applications.

> **Note:** The core code of the framework is available at [Wolff-framework](https://github.com/usbac/wolff-framework).

## Features

üìì **Extremely easy**: It's simple to use and has a clean documentation and interface. It gives you the opportunity to learn it in just a single night (sleep included).

üöÄ **Ridiculously fast**: If a resource is not used, it's not loaded. Some elements of the framework can even be disabled. Wolff is very friendly with potato servers and works seamlessly.

üõ†Ô∏è **Comprenhensive**: Wolff has elements that cover everything you may ever need for building a web app. Absolutely no initial setup is required. They are ready to use.
